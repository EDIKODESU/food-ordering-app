# food-ordering-app
The aim of the work is to provide the possibility of ordering food via the Internet in a limited use environment, without the need for physical presence in the establishment, through a convenient, fast web application.


The object of research is food ordering via the Internet.


The subject of the research is the principles of ordering and delivering food in a restaurant, studying the order processing process and researching the system for storing data on the food and beverage menu.


The created software was developed in the JavaScrips programming language using the Node.js platform, as well as a set of libraries, such as: Express, Axios and Sequelize. Databases such as MySQL were used for data storage. The use of this programming language and database allowed us to provide the necessary functionality and efficient operation of the software.


The developed web application helps to reduce order processing time, reduce the risk of errors, and increase customer satisfaction, which can lead to increased customer loyalty, sales, and profits. In addition, it allows customers to conveniently and quickly place orders online, eliminating the need for them to physically visit the establishment, which provides greater accessibility and convenience for customers, as well as rationalizing staff work and reducing the cost of manual order processing.

## Project deployment
The system should be deployed by a qualified specialist on the equipment located in the institution. The deployment process should be carried out in accordance with the following algorithm:
+ make sure that Node.js and MySQL are installed on the target server;
+ restore the database using the file with SQL commands included in the software package;
+ using the npm package manager, download all the necessary libraries that are added to the requirements of the operating system, including Sequelize, Express, JWT packages, and configure the application configuration;
+ place the Node.js program using Express, which is included in the software package, in the required file;
+ run the software by specifying the correct listening port;
+ test the deployed software on the target server by sending HTTP requests and making sure that all functionality, including MySQL database processing via Sequelize and authentication using JWT, works properly.
